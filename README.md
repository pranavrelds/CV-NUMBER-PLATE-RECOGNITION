# CV-NUMBER-PLATE-RECOGNITION

## Problem Statement
In the following project, we will understand how to recognize License number plates using Python. We will utilize OpenCV for this project in order to identify the license number plates and the Paddle OCR for the characters and digits extraction from the plate. We will create a web app with a Flask framework that automatically recognizes the License Number Plate .
